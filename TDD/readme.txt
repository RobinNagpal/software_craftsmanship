1) There is a folder solution_without_tdd which contains the solution of most of the attenees that were implemented without TDD. Only one of them followed TDD and a couple of others has acceptable code.  This can be used to show comparisn of code using TDD and without it.

2) Presenter can choose his own problem statement to show how TDD is done

3) It is recommended that Presenter Uses the same problem statement given here for the audiance but can simplefy it. We want to keep the problem statement same so that trainers can discuss the results of trainings with other developers.
